# MachineLearning
Python code of Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. 

I have used the concepts from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning and Deep Learning course in coursera. So big thanks to him.

### Linear Regression

I have implemented two approaches.

1) One without vectors,i.e., regular code with 2 loops. ## Computationally expensive.
2) Vector Implementation. ## Runs way faster than above.

### Logistic Regression

Like Linear regression, I too have implemented two approaches.

1) Without using vectors
2) Using Vectors

### Neural Networks

For writing the algorithm of Neural Networks, I have implemented Vector approach.

Note: For now, I have incorporated tanh and sigmoid activation functions for hidden and output layers respectively. I am planning to replace them with Relu activation function.
